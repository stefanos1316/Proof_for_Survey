Actually I did find it, I think, I just used the command $./jolinar java Benchmark and seems  it's working now.

Hello Adel,

Sorry for the interruption again, I disabled the intel_pstate module, although I get some other error with warning such as this:

Any idea how can I solve it?

p.s. application by itself runs normally.

I probably was unclear, I mean by “old” the kernel module (not the hardware).
The Linux kernel got, a few years ago, a new more efficient module to manage CPU states and energy, which, unfortunately, doesn’t provide detailed statistics as the older module.
